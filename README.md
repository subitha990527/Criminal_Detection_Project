# Criminal Detection System

**Criminal Detection System** is a web-based application designed to enhance criminal identification using live camera feeds. This project aims to detect criminals in a crowd by comparing individuals in the camera feed with a dataset of known criminals, including those yet to be apprehended.

## How It Works
1. The system uses live camera feeds to capture real-time video.
2. Each individual in the camera frame is compared against a dataset of known criminals.
3. If a match is found, the system highlights the identified individual and displays their details.
4. Users (Admin, Police Station, and Public) have access to specific modules to manage and view data.
